# Maze-Traversal
 Maze Traversal using both a stack and a queue

Read in a maze from a text file where the start is represented by 'S', the finish is represented by 'F', walkable paths are represented by '.' and walls are represented by '#'.
Maze is then traversed twice using both a queue and a stack and the found paths are printed to the console.
